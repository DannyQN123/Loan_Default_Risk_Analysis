# Home_Credit_Default_Risk_prediction

## Big Question: 
- What are the factors that influence Home Credit customers' repayment ability ?
- This is a Binary-Classification problem.

## Steps: 
1. Identify 4 factors that can affect a customer's repayment ability
2. From these 4 factors, derive some actionable business insights.
3. Also from these 4 factors, perform feature-engineering ==> we have 2 engineered-features (the other 2 features are given)
4. Build 3 Predictive Models: Logistics Regression, Random Forest, LGBM 
5. Use ROC AUC as the metric to evaluate the 3 models and determine that LGBM is the best model for this problem 
6. Put the 4 engineered features into our LGBM model, and see that these 4 engineered features helped improved our baseline-LGBM model
7. Conclusion: what business insights is derived from these **factors** , and are the **engineered** features helped improve our predictive model.
8. Next step suggestions.

## ROC AUC Score of different models
- Baseline are baseline models without adding engineered features
